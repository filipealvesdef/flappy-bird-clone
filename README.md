# Flappy Bird clone

This game was implemented for didatic porpouses and this repository was used as material for a workshop that I ministred during the Computer Science Studies Week (SECCOMP) in October of 2017 at SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro - Brazil.

Feel free to use, modify and share it as you wish but it would be cool if you give me due credits :)
